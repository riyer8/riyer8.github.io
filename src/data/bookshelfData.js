    notes: ` Some of my favorite principles:
      9. The world is a museum of passion projects.
      21. You are probably too risk-averse. Write out the worst things that can happen, realize they‚Äôre not that bad, then take the leap.
      23. Doing things is energizing, wasting time is depressing. You don‚Äôt need that much ‚Äòrest‚Äô.
      31. Figure out what creates enduring value.
      34. ‚ÄúAim for Chartres‚Äù (Christopher Alexander) ‚Äî when doing something, aim to be the best there ever was at it. This compensates for your natural bias, which is to do something mediocre. You have to really aim to be as good as the greats.
      35. Send more cold emails. People respond! Assume everyone‚Äôs your friend.
      51. Be honest about whether something is learning or entertainment. Real learning is extremely hard and effortful.
